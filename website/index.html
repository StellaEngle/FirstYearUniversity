<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>HTML (<strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>) is used to create Web Pages. It was firstly developed to be very simple and to handle only text-based documents. With the passage of time the web became more and more popular, so new versions of HTML were developed to support new features like embedding images and multimedia therefore extending the functionality of a web page.</p>
<p>In November 1995, HTML 2.0 was published and later in January 1997 HTML 3.2 also known and as “Wilbur” was released and standardised most common features like tables, page structure, frames, images and forms. Moreover, in December 1999 HTML 4.1 was published and supported scripting languages like JavaScript, more multimedia options than previous versions of HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and accessibility features. In January 2000 XHTML 1.0 was published. It uses XML markup rules (tags and attributes names must be in lowercase, special characters must use the correct entity values and etc.). Lastly, in December 2012 HTML5 was introduced. It can be written using HTML or XHTML syntax. Additionally, it provides new features such as logical audio and video elements for media playback (&lt;audio&gt;, &lt;video&gt;), animation and drawing with CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheet 3) and many other features.</p>
<p>CSS (<strong>Cascading Style Sheet</strong>) is used to style a document written in a markup language. It is easy to create and it makes web pages look much better and easier to use. CSS have their own formatting rules.</p>
<p>There are different versions of Cascading Style Sheet. In December CSS level 1 was published, it supports font properties backgrounds, margin, border, padding, positioning and alignment of images, texts, tables and many other elements. In May 1998 CSS level 2 was published. Furthermore CSS 2.1 was finally published in June 2011. It corrects some errors found in CSS level 2 and some other features of CSS level 2 were removed completely. Another version of CSS is the CSS 3, it was split into “modules”. These modules provide backward capability and also add many new features to it. CSS 3 is still under development. </p>
<p>In this web site we are going to cover how to create a web page using HTML5 and CSS 3.</p>
